Description: ctsem is an R package for continuous time structural equation
    modelling.  ctsem interfaces to the the OpenMx package
    (available from http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu/), and provides an easily
    accessible dynamic modelling approach for panel and time series data.  Most
    dynamic modelling approaches to longitudinal data rely on the assumption
    that time intervals between observations are consistent.  When this
    assumption is adhered to, the data gathering process is necessarily limited
    to a specific schedule, and when broken, the resulting parameter estimates
    may be biased and reduced in power.  Continuous time models are
    conceptually similar to vector autoregressive models (thus also the latent
    change models popularised in a structural equation modelling context),
    however by explicitly including the length of time between observations,
    continuous time models are freed from the assumption that measurement
    intervals are consistent.  This allows: data to be gathered irregularly;
    the elimination of noise and bias due to varying measurement intervals.
    The application of such a model in an SEM framework allows full-information
    maximum-likelihood estimates for both N = 1 and N > 1 cases, multiple
    measured indicators per latent process, and the flexibility to incorporate
    additional elements, including individual heterogeneity in the latent
    process and manifest intercepts, and time dependent and independent
    exogenous covariates. Furthermore, due to the SEM implementation we are
    able to estimate a random effects model where the impact of time dependent
    and time independent predictors can be assessed simultaneously, but without
    the classic problems of random effects models assuming no covariance
    between unit level effects and predictors.  The flexibility of ctsem may
    also of course be applicable for modelling of datasets where the
    observations are regularly spaced.
