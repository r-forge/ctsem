Research into individual differences in gratitude and well-being is reviewed, including gratitude and psychopathology, personality, relationships, health, subjective and eudemonic well-being, and humanistically orientated functioning. Gratitude is strongly related to well-being, however defined, and this link may be unique and causal. Interventions to clinically increase gratitude are critically reviewed, and concluded to be promising, although the positive psychology literature may have neglected current limitations, and a distinct research strategy is suggested. Finally, mechanisms whereby gratitude may relate to well-being are discussed, including schematic biases, coping, positive affect, and broaden-and-build principles. Gratitude is relevant to clinical psychology due to (a) strong explanatory power in understanding well-being, and (b) the potential of improving well-being through fostering gratitude with simple exercises.

	abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is now a generic modeling framework for many multivariate techniques applied in the social and behavioral sciences. Many statistical models can be considered either as special cases of SEM or as part of the latent variable modeling framework. One popular extension is the use of SEM to conduct linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM) such as cross-sectional multilevel modeling and latent growth modeling. It is well known that LMM can be formulated as structural equation models. However, one main difference between the implementations in SEM and LMM is that maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is usually used in SEM, whereas restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood (REML) estimation is the default method in most LMM packages. This article shows how REML estimation can be implemented in SEM. Two empirical examples on latent growth model and meta-analysis are used to illustrate the procedures implemented in OpenMx. Issues related to implementing REML in SEM are discussed.},

In this context, the words attenuation and underestimation refer to the shrinkage toward zero of path coefficient estimates due to measurement error. The words inflation and overestimation refer to the expansion away from zero of path coefficient estimates.{\textquotedblright} Footnote 4 should have stated, {\textquotedblleft}We make several assumptions in our path diagrams . . .{\textquotedblright} The first sentence in the first full paragraph on page 5 should have stated, {\textquotedblleft}Fourth, the overestimation of any directional path is due to the underestimation of the sum of all valid tracings responsible for the covariation between the two variables of interest (other than the tracing that consists of the target path). All versions have been corrected.] Despite clear evidence that manifest variable path analysis requires highly reliable measures, path analyses with fallible measures are commonplace even in premier journals. Using fallible measures in path analysis can cause several serious problems: (a) As measurement error pervades a given data set, many path coefficients may be either over- or underestimated. (b) Extensive measurement error diminishes power and can prevent invalid models from being rejected. (c) Even a little measurement error can cause valid models to appear invalid. (d) Differential measurement error in various parts of a model can change the substantive conclusions that derive from path analysis. (e) All of these problems become increasingly serious and intractable as models become more complex. Methods to prevent and correct these problems are reviewed. The conclusion is that researchers should use more reliable measures (or correct for measurement error in the measures they do use), obtain multiple measures for use in latent variable modeling, and test simpler models containing fewer variables.},

The paper uses regional sunshine as an instrument for personal happiness using the Dutch Household Survey from the Netherlands. Sunshine improves happiness significantly. Instrumenting happiness with sunshine, happier people are found to save more, spend less, and have a lower marginal propensity to consume. Happier people take more time for making decisions and have more control over expenditures; they expect a longer life and (accordingly) seem more concerned about the future than the present; they also expect less inflation in the future.

Participants who described a positive experience using the imperfective aspect, which implies ongoing progression, subsequently reported more positive mood and greater happiness than did participants who described a positive experience using the perfective aspect, which implies completion; likewise, participants who described a negative experience using the imperfective aspect subsequently reported more negative mood and less happiness than did participants who described a negative experience using the perfective aspect. These effects were traced to enhanced memory for the described emotional experience in the imperfective condition relative to the perfective condition. The findings demonstrate how formal features of language shape both the reinstatement of past affective reactions and happiness judgments, and may have practical applications for improving subjective well-being.},

Using these results we derive the inconsistencies for implied impulse responses and variance decompositions. Employing a trivariate economic model, we examine the potential seriousness of these misspecifications in applied work.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review This review highlights recent work evaluating the relationship between exercise, physical activity and physical and mental health. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, as well as randomized clinical trials, are included. Special attention is given to physical conditions, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease and sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, studies relating physical activity to depression and other mood states are reviewed. The studies include diverse ethnic populations, including men and women, as well as several age groups (e.g. adolescents, middle-aged and older adults). Recent findings Results of the studies continue to support a growing literature suggesting that exercise, physical activity and physical-activity interventions have beneficial effects across several physical and mental-health outcomes. Generally, participants engaging in regular physical activity display more desirable health outcomes across a variety of physical conditions. Similarly, participants in randomized clinical trials of physical-activity interventions show better health outcomes, including better general and health-related quality of life, better functional capacity and better mood states. Summary The studies have several implications for clinical practice and research. Most work suggests that exercise and physical activity are associated with better quality of life and health outcomes. Therefore, assessment and promotion of exercise and physical activity may be beneficial in achieving desired benefits across several populations. Several limitations were noted, particularly in research involving randomized clinical trials. These trials tend to involve limited sample sizes with short follow-up periods, thus limiting the clinical implications of the benefits associated with physical activity.},

	abstract = {In multilevel modeling (MLM), group-level (L2) characteristics are often measured by aggregating individual-level (L1) characteristics within each group so as to assess contextual effects (e.g., group-average effects of socioeconomic status, achievement, climate). Most previous applications have used a multilevel manifest covariate (MMC) approach, in which the observed (manifest) group mean is assumed to be perfectly reliable. This article demonstrates mathematically and with simulation results that this MMC approach can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects and can substantially underestimate the associated standard errors, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the sampling ratio (the percentage of cases within each group sampled), and the nature of the data. To address this pervasive problem, the authors introduce a new multilevel latent covariate (MLC) approach that corrects for unreliability at L2 and results in unbiased estimates of L2 constructs under appropriate conditions. However, under some circumstances when the sampling ratio approaches 100\%, the MMC approach provides more accurate estimates. Based on 3 simulations and 2 real-data applications, the authors evaluate the MMC and MLC approaches and suggest when researchers should most appropriately use one, the other, or a combination of both approaches.},

	abstract = {Latent state-trait (LST) analysis is frequently applied in psychological research to determine the degree to which observed scores reflect stable person-specific effects, effects of situations and/or person-situation interactions, and random measurement error. Most LST applications use multiple repeatedly measured observed variables as indicators of latent trait and latent state residual factors. In practice, such indicators often show shared indicator-specific (or method) variance over time. In this article, the authors compare 4 approaches to account for such method effects in LST models and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach based on theoretical considerations, simulations, and applications to actual data sets. The simulation study revealed that the LST model with indicator-specific traits (Eid, 1996) and the LST model with M - 1 correlated method factors (Eid, Schneider, \& Schwenkmezger, 1999) performed well, whereas the model with M orthogonal method factors used in the early work of Steyer, Ferring, and Schmitt (1992) and the correlated uniqueness approach (Kenny, 1976) showed limitations under conditions of either low or high method-specificity.

Dominant models of subjective well-being (SWB) suggest that people can adapt to almost any life event and that happiness levels fluctuate around a biologically determined set point that rarely changes. Recent evidence from large-scale panel studies challenges aspects of this conclusion. Although inborn factors certainly matter and some adaptation does occur, events such as divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, and disability are associated with lasting changes in SWB. These recent studies also show that there are considerable individual differences in the extent to which people adapt. Thus, happiness levels do change, and adaptation is not inevitable.},

A transformation of these parameters is introduced, based on the Cayley-Hamilton transformation. The new parameter space is identical with that of discrete time autoregressive models. The model is also modified by the introduction of prescribed moving average terms. The resulting modelling improvements include rapid and reliable convergence of parameter estimates and the ability to select the model order by testing whether the highest order coefficient is 0.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider two basic aspects of demand analysis, with application to the demand for natural gas in the residential and commercial market. The more fundamental one consists in the formulation of a demand function for commodities--such as natural gas--whose consumption is technologically related to the stock of appliances. We believe that in such markets, the behavior of the consumer can be described best in terms of a dynamic mechanism. Related to this is the more specific problem of estimating the parameters of the demand function, when the demand model is cast in dynamic terms and when observations are drawn from a time series of cross sections. Accordingly, this paper is centered around these two major themes, although, as the title suggests, the emphasis is placed on the second one. In Section 1, we present the theoretical formulation of the dynamic model for gas. In Section 2, the results of the estimation of the gas model by ordinary least squares methods are presented. These results, together with more fundamental theoretical considerations, suggest a different approach. The essence of this approach, which is not restricted to the gas model, is discussed in Section 3, while two alternative procedures for estimating the coefficients of the dynamic model in the light of this new approach are proposed in Section 4. It is subsequently shown that the application of these procedures to the gas data produces results that are reasonable on the basis of a priori theoretical considerations.},

However, coping strategies might appear beneficial in a given situation, but when considered in the broader stressor context, those situational benefits may actually undermine well-being. Two studies (N = 473 and N = 80 women) demonstrated that, in the context of psychologically or physically abusive dating relationships, coping orientations were rooted in women's stressor history (prior assault trauma) and elevated emotion-focused and lower problem-focused efforts were predictive of greater depressive symptoms. Yet, in response to a stressor video that acted as a reminder of women's abusive experiences (but not to a stressor video unrelated to abuse), affective benefits (lower hostility, higher positive agency) were associated with abused women's emotion-focused coping endorsements, but were not linked to problem-focused coping. It seems that in some contexts, reduced distress might limit active efforts to alter a dysfunctional situation.},

	abstract = {Social capital has previously been reviewed in relation to mental health. However, none have focused specifically on positive aspects of mental health such as mental well-being. This review aimed to explore the relationship between social capital and mental well-being in older people. Ten relevant databases were systematically searched using an extensive search strategy for studies, analyzing the link between social capital and mental well-being. Criteria for inclusion in the systematic review were: the study sample included older people (50 years); the study reported a mental well-being outcome; social capital was an exposure variable; and empirical research using quantitative methods and published in English, between January 1990 and September 2011. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Each study was assessed against seven possible exposure measures (structural, cognitive; bonding, bridging, linking; individual, collective). The results showed that all included studies found positive associations between parts of social capital and aspects of mental well-being. Typically, the relationship between social capital and mental well-being differed within as well as between studies. Our results highlight that there is no gold standard' of how to measure social capital or mental well-being. Social capital is generated in the interaction between individual and collective life. A possibility for future research is therefore to follow Bronfenbrenner's classical division into macro, meso, and micro levels. We consider family and friends at the micro level to be the key factors in generating social capital and well-being in older people.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the performance of six types of techniques for comparisons of means is examined. These six emerge from the distinction between the method employed (hypothesis testing, model selection using information criteria, or Bayesian model selection) and the set of hypotheses that is investigated (a classical, exploration-based set of hypotheses containing equality constraints on the means, or a theory-based limited set of hypotheses with equality and/or order restrictions). A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of these techniques. We demonstrate that, if one has specific, a priori specified hypotheses, confirmation (i.e., investigating theory-based hypotheses) has advantages over exploration (i.e., examining all possible equality-constrained hypotheses). Furthermore, examining reasonable order-restricted hypotheses has more power to detect the true effect/non-null hypothesis than evaluating only equality restrictions. Additionally, when investigating more than one theory-based hypothesis, model selection is preferred over hypothesis testing. Because of the first two results, we further examine the techniques that are able to evaluate order restrictions in a confirmatory fashion by examining their performance when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated. Results show that the techniques are robust to heterogeneity when the sample sizes are equal. When the sample sizes are unequal, the performance is affected by heterogeneity. The size and direction of the deviations from the baseline, where there is no heterogeneity, depend on the effect size (of the means) and on the trend in the group variances with respect to the ordering of the group sizes. Importantly, the deviations are less pronounced when the group variances and sizes exhibit the same trend (e.g., are both increasing with group number).},

Modern software programs for handling unbalanced longitudinal data improve on methods that discard the incomplete cases by including all the data, but also yield biased inferences under plausible models for the drop-out process. This article discusses methods that simultaneously model the data and the dropout process within a unified model-based framework. Models are classified into two broad classes-random-coefficient selection models and random-coefficient pattern-mixture models-depending on how the joint distribution of the data and dropout mechanism is factored. Inference is likelihood-based, via maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. A number of examples in the literature are placed in this framework. and possible extensions outlined. Data collection on the nature of the dropout process is advocated to guide the choice of model. In cases where the drop-out mechanism is not well understood, sensitivity analyses are suggested to assess the effect on inferences about target quantities of alternative assumptions about the dropout process.},

Although both directions of causality are theoretically possible and the BJW theory explicitly states that direction of causality is from BJW to SWB, until now the causal direction of these associations had not been empirically tested. The three experimental studies presented in this paper include manipulations of either BJW, mood or life satisfaction. A total of 338 undergraduate students participated. There were no effects of experimentally induced mood changes on BJW (Study 1) but the saliency of life satisfaction reinforced BJW (Study 2). An increase in self-reported life satisfaction when BJW is primed was found (Study 3), although the activation of BJW had no impact on the mood of the participants (Study 3). Therefore, the present results show that transient affective states do not influence or are influenced by BJW, and that this relationship is present only for the more stable affective dispositions. These studies therefore support the bilateral character of the association between life satisfaction and BJW.},

	abstract = {Researchers generally agree that Subjective Wellbeing (SWB) comprises both cognitive and affective components. However, the proportioning of their contributions, and the relationship between these constructs and personality, remain equivocal. This study investigated the relationship between these constructs, representing affect by Homeostatically Protected Mood (HPMood). Using a sample of 205 Victorian high-school students aged between 13 and 20 years, structural equation modeling determined that an HPMood-driven model of SWB was better fitting than either a personality-driven model of SWB or a cognition-driven model of SWB, explaining 80\% of variance. These results support HPMood as the major component of SWB. They also reinforce the proposition that HPMood may be the driving force behind individual SWB set-points and the variable that SWB homeostasis seeks to defend.},

The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

	abstract = {To examine the differences in subjective well-being among people with different household income. Data were obtained from the national survey conducted in June 2005, in which a representative sample of 896 participants were administered a questionnaire on several measures of subjective well-being as follows: happiness, life satisfaction, and satisfaction with different life domains (personal and national well-being index). One-way ANOVA was performed to test the differences in subjective well-being measures between participants grouped into six categories according to their monthly income. Happiness and life satisfaction ratings, as well as ratings of satisfaction with several life domains differed significantly between groups of people with different monthly income. Respondents with higher income felt happier (P{\textless}0.001), more satisfied with their life as a whole (P{\textless}0.001), more satisfied with their material status (P{\textless}0.001), health (P{\textless}0.001), achievement (P{\textless}0.001), future security (P=0.001), economic situation (P=0.001), state of the environment (P=0.003), and social conditions in Croatia (P=0.003). However, no significant differences were found between the two groups with the lowest income (0-70 euros and 71-130 euro per person per month), nor between the two groups with the highest income (401-530 euros and 531+ euros per person per month). Our study showed that income and material wealth had an influence on subjective well-being in contemporary Croatian society, which is undergoing major social and economical changes.},

These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment, but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally. Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes are more fundamental than environments.},

Due to basic limitations of cross-sectional designs and a reluctance to disentangle antecedent{\textendash}consequent relations in longitudinal designs, the functional significance and dynamics of these links have remained unclear. Advanced structural equation models allow representing multivariate longitudinal changes as a function of time-based and directed relations. We applied this methodology to longitudinal data from the Berlin Aging Study (at inception total N = 516; age range = 70{\textendash}103 years) to explore the structural dynamics among perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, close visual acuity, and distance visual acuity. We found reliable, occasion-based, age-partialed latent regression paths that influence longitudinal changes within and across intellectual and sensory domains. We conclude that intellectual and sensory domains are dynamically linked in old and very old age, and discuss implications of this finding for theories of cognitive aging.},

An important part of understanding how youths perceive their lives is the incorporation of measurement of life satisfaction, and this article provides a review of the extant measures of youth life satisfaction. Following systematic literature searches, empirical studies (n = 47) of youth LS measures are reviewed.

However, it is unclear whether this general development applies to all employees, while also little is known about the underlying processes causing such an improvement. Our research questions were: (1) Does every worker experience a positive effect of vacation on H\&W? and (2) Can vacation activities and experiences explain changes in H\&W during vacation? In a 7-week longitudinal field study, 96 workers reported their H\&W 2 weeks before, during, 1 week, 2 and 4 weeks after a winter sports vacation on 6 indicators (health status, mood, fatigue, tension, energy level and satisfaction). Sixty percent of the sample experienced substantial improvement of H\&W during and after vacation. Yet, a small group experienced no (23\%) or a negative effect of vacation (17\%). Spending limited time on passive activities, pleasure derived from vacation activities, and the absence of negative incidents during vacation explained 38\% of the variance in the vacation effect. Although vacation has a positive, longer lasting effect for many, it is not invariably positive for all employees. Choosing especially pleasant vacation activities and avoiding negative incidents as well as passive activities during active vacations apparently contributes to the positive effect of vacation on H\&W.},

Results from cross-sectional (Ns = 129 and 64) and longitudinal (N = 129) studies suggest that there is a parsimonious answer to this question. Life events are closely related to mood states, mood states are closely related to cognitive WE, and mood states appear to serve as the nexus through which changing life circumstances affect cognitive WE. These results are consistent with a mood-mediation model, which assumes that mood states perform several functions for the individual. As a reactive index, mood states provide a hedonic summary of recent life experiences. As a prospective index, mood states inform the individual about one's progress and prospects in important life domains. Together, the results indicate that affective experiences play a central role in linking daily life to cognitive representations of well-being.},

Existing approaches use longitudinal data to isolate occasion-specific variance from variance that is either completely stable or variance that changes systematically over time. In these approaches, reliable occasion-specific variance is typically treated as measurement error, which would negatively bias reliability estimates. In the current studies, panel data and multivariate latent state-trait models are used to isolate reliable occasion-specific variance from random error and to estimate reliability for scores from single-item life satisfaction measures. Across four nationally representative panel studies with a combined sample size of over 68,000, reliability estimates increased by an average of 16\% when the multivariate model was used instead of the more standard univariate longitudinal model.},

	abstract = {A huge cross-section literature, written by economists and others, argues that human wellbeing is U-shaped through the life cycle. In many cases this U-shape is robust (with a well-known exception the pattern evident in some U.S. data sets if few independent variables are included). However, a lively debate is currently ongoing about its true shape. This paper discusses the identification problem of age, time, and cohort effects. It suggests a simple way to interpret estimates of age variables in a first-difference framework. Building on McKenzie's (2006) methodology, the paper shows that no extra assumptions are needed in order to identify the second derivative of well-being to age, i.e. to estimate the changes in the actual age and well-being relationship. An empirical application, using a large German data set, finds that human well-being is convex in age until after midlife, which is approximately consistent with a U-shaped pattern through life, and not with the concave relationship sometimes found in U.S. studies.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 736 men and women aged 58-72 years, with positive affect assessed by aggregating ecological momentary samples. Sleep problems were assessed with the Jenkins Sleep Problems Scale, and psychosocial risk factors were measured by standardized questionnaires. Results: Both positive affect and eudaimonic well-being were inversely associated with sleep problems after adjustment for age, gender, household income, and self-rated health (P {\textless}.001). Negative psychosocial factors including financial strain, social isolation, low emotional support, negative social interactions, and psychological distress were also related to reported sleep problems. The strength of these associations was reduced by 20-73\% when positive affect and eudaimonic well-being were taken into account, suggesting that effects were partly mediated by positive psychological states. Conclusions: These results suggest that both positive affect and eudaimonic well-being are directly associated with good sleep and may buffer the impact of psychosocial risk factors. The relationships are likely to be bidirectional, with disturbed sleep engendering lower positive affect and reduced psychological well-being, and positive psychological states promoting better sleep.

Without any loss of enthusiasm for the basic premises of SEM, it is fair to say that there were several knowledgeable researchers who suggested that the LISREL concept and computer program was not actually the best way to deal with such problems, and Roderick P. McDonald (1980) was among the most vocal (Loehlin, 1987, 1998, 2004; McDonald, 1985b). In McDonald{\textquoteright}s alternative approach, the newly available computer programming he created allowed an unrestricted level of higher order common factors that he termed covariance structure analysis (COSAN). The use of the resulting concepts and computer program produced exactly the same numerical values as LISREL, but it was not nearly as popular as LISREL, and this was unfortunate because COSAN was free software. The notation we will use here{\textemdash}the reticular action model (RAM){\textemdash}is slightly different, because it uses a simplified algebra to match the diagrams (see Figure 2.4). As stated earlier, it is not necessary to use any particular algebraic notation as long as the general SEM principles are followed. Nevertheless, our own interest in path diagrams also led to another innovation in the calculation schemes. Our prior use of COSAN proved instrumental in asserting that the eight-matrix notation, and the entire LISREL concept, was not the only correct way to carry out SEM (Horn \& McArdle, 1980). In fact, a practical comparison of COSAN and LISREL applications led directly to the simplification known as RAM theory (McArdle, 1979, 2005; McArdle \& McDonald, 1984).},

The outcomes from random effect modeling reveal significant positive impacts of political globalization, whereas economic and social globalization do not generate favorable influences when development level and regional differences are operated as controls. The overall globalization index is found to generate expected favorable influence on an overall human development index. Within developing countries, globalization's human influence was not as significant as in industrial countries, however. Several hypotheses about globalization's potential negative effects through increasing societal instabilities and reducing state power and social spending are not supported in analysis.

	abstract = {Growing up in a poor neighbourhood has negative effects on children and adolescents. In the literature it has been concluded that the risk of low birth weight, childhood injury and abuse, and teenage pregnancy or criminality double in poor areas. However, the validity of such studies has been questioned, as they have been associated with ecological or individualistic fallacies. Studies using multilevel technique might thus contribute important knowledge in this field. The present review clarifies the importance of neighbourhood contextual factors in child and adolescent health outcomes, through considering only studies using multilevel technique. Keyword searching of the Medline, ERIC, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Citation Index databases was performed. Original studies using multilevel technique to examine the effect of neighbourhood characteristics on child and adolescent health outcomes, and focusing on populations in high-income countries were included. Neighbourhood socioeconomic status and social climate were shown to have small to moderate effects on child health outcomes, i.e. birth weight, injuries, behavioural problems, and child maltreatment. On average, 10\% of variation in health outcomes was explained by neighbourhood determinants, after controlling for important individual and family variables. This review demonstrates that interventions in underprivileged neighbourhoods can reduce health risks to children, especially in families that lack resources. An analysis of methodological fallacies indicates that observed effects and effect sizes can be underestimated, and that interventions may well have greater impact than this review was able to establish.},

	abstract = {Subjective well-being (SWB) is an important indicator of quality oflife. SWB can be conceptualized as a momentary state (e.g., mood) aswell as a relatively stable trait (e.g., life satisfaction). Thevalidity of self-reported trait aspects of SWB has been questioned byexperimental studies showing that SWB judgments seem to be stronglycontext dependent. Particularly, momentary mood seems to have a stronginfluence on global SWB judgments. To explore the ecological validity ofthese conclusions a non-experimental longitudinal self-reportstudy with three occasions of measurement was conducted(N = 249). The associations between momentarymood ratings and global judgments of SWB (life satisfaction,satisfaction with life domains, frequency and intensity of emotions) aswell as personality ratings (self-esteem, optimism, neuroticism,extraversion) were analyzed in a multistate-multitrait-multiconstructmodel. This model takes (a) measurement error, (b) occasion-specificdeviations, and (c) stable interindividual differences into account. Itis shown that the variability in global SWB judgments and personalityratings is relatively small and much smaller than the variability inmood. Furthermore, the occasion-specific associations between moodstates, on the one hand, and global SWB and personality ratings, on theother hand, are relatively small and inconsistent. All global SWB andpersonality variables are more strongly related to mood on the traitlevel than on the occasion-specific deviation level. Therefore, incontrast to experimental studies, occasion-specific mood effects do notseem to be inherently important in ecological measurement settings.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Oxytocin (OT) has long been implicated in maternal bonding, sexual behavior and social affiliation behaviors. This paper reviews the wide effects of oxytocin and its key role in well-being. Methods: Studies were identified through Medline, Pubmed, and PsychINFO search of the English-language literature from the past sixty years (1959 to 2009) using the key word "oxytocin" in human studies. Of the 287 articles identified, 102 were selected for review. Results: OT induces a general sense of well-being including calm, improved social interactions, increased trust, and reduced fear as well as endocrine and physiological changes. Some central effects of OT are temporary and its release is associated with induction of secondary biochemical actions which mediate long-term benefits including blood pressure reduction, calm and affiliative behavior. As OT release is augmented by touch and physiological support so the hormone is involved in both the cause and benefits of social interactions. Just as OT has widespread effects in factors encompassing well-being, its dysfunction is associated with morbidity and decreased quality of life as observed neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and social phobias. Conclusions: Oxytocin (OT) is of potential use in enhancing interpersonal and individual wellbeing, and might have more applications in neuropsychiatric disorders especially those characterized by persistent fear, repetitive behavior, reduced trust and avoidance of social interactions.

Aims To test the public health impact of the escalating sales of antidepressants.
Method Nationwide data from Iceland are used as an example to study the effect of sales of antidepressants on suicide, disability, hospital admissions and out-patient visits.
Results Sales of antidepressants increased from 8.4 daily defined doses per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1975 to 72.7 in 2000, which is a user prevalence of 8.7\% for the adult population. Suicide rates fluctuated during 1950{\textendash}2000 but did not show any definite trend. Rates for out-patient visits increased slightly over the period 1989{\textendash}2000 and admission rates increased even more. The prevalence of disability due to depressive and anxiety disorders has notdecreased over the past 25 years.
Conclusions The dramatic increase in the sales of antidepressants has not had any marked impact on the selected public health measures. Obviously, better treatment for depressive disorders is still needed in order to reduce the burden caused by them.},

In an alternative representation, constructs can be defined as linear functions of their indicators, called causal indicators, plus an error term. Such constructs are not latent variables but composite variables, and they have no indicators in the conventional sense. The presence of composite variables in a model can, in some situations, result in problems with identification of model parameters. Also, the use of causal indicators can produce models that imply zero correlation among many measured variables, a problem resolved only by the inclusion of a potentially large number of additional parameters. These phenomena are demonstrated with an example, and general principles underlying them are discussed. Remedies are described so as to allow for the evaluation of models that contain causal indicators.},

Three classes of evidence-cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental-are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect-the hallmark of well-being-may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness. Limitations, empirical issues, and important future research questions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: There has been an 8-fold increase in use of the term resilience within scientific and scholar literature over the last twenty years. The arena of public policy has also seen increasing use made of the concept, both with respect to child well-being and development and wider issues. Method: A focal sample of literature comprising 108 papers addressing public policy implications of work on child resilience was identified by a structured bibliographic search. Results: This literature suggests that current work: is characterized by a breadth of sectoral engagement across the fields of education, social work, and health; demonstrates diversity with regard to the systemic levels individual (biological and psychological), communal (including systems of faith and cultural identity), institutional and societal with which it engages; but is based more upon conceptual rather than empirical analysis. Major themes of policy recommendation target strengthened family dynamics, increased capacity for counseling and mental health services, supportive school environments, development of community programs, promotion of socioeconomic improvement and adoption of a more comprehensive conception of resilience. Evaluations of resiliency-informed policy initiatives are limited in number, with greatest rigor in design associated with more discrete programmatic interventions. Conclusion: A number of strategies to strengthen research-policy linkages are identified. These include greater commitment to operationalize indicators of resilience at all levels of analysis; more coherent engagement with the policy making process through explicit knowledge translation initiatives; and developing complex adaptive systems models amenable to exploring policy scenarios.},

The conditional pseudo R 2 and concordance correlation could detect misspecification when it occurred in the conditional mean structure (individual change trajectory) or in both mean structures.

The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

Both are important antagonists to the negative affect of unforgiveness and agonists for positive affect. One key distinction emerging in the literature is between decisional and emotional forgiveness. Decisional forgiveness is a behavioral intention to resist an unforgiving stance and to respond differently toward a transgressor. Emotional forgiveness is the replacement of negative unforgiving emotions with positive other-oriented emotions. Emotional forgiveness involves psychophysiological changes, and it has more direct health and well-being consequences. While some benefits of forgiveness and forgivingness emerge merely because they reduce unforgiveness, some benefits appear to be more forgiveness specific. We review research on peripheral and central nervous system correlates of forgiveness, as well as existing interventions to promote forgiveness within divergent health settings. Finally, we propose a research agenda.},

AIMS: To test the public health impact of the escalating sales of antidepressants.
METHOD: Nationwide data from Iceland are used as an example to study the effect of sales of antidepressants on suicide, disability, hospital admissions and out-patient visits.
RESULTS: Sales of antidepressants increased from 8.4 daily defined doses per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1975 to 72.7 in 2000, which is a user prevalence of 8.7\% for the adult population. Suicide rates fluctuated during 1950-2000 but did not show any definite trend. Rates for out-patient visits increased slightly over the period 1989-2000 and admission rates increased even more. The prevalence of disability due to depressive and anxiety disorders has not decreased over the past 25 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The dramatic increase in the sales of antidepressants has not had any marked impact on the selected public health measures. Obviously, better treatment for depressive disorders is still needed in order to reduce the burden caused by them.},

	abstract = {Whether level 1 predictors should be centered per cluster has received considerable attention in the multilevel literature. While most agree that there is no one preferred approach, it has also been argued that cluster mean centering is desirable when the within-cluster slope and the between-cluster slope are expected to deviate, and the main interest is in the within-cluster slope. However, we show in a series of simulations that if one has a multilevel autoregressive model in which the level 1 predictor is the lagged outcome variable (i.e., the outcome variable at the previous occasion), cluster mean centering will in general lead to a downward bias in the parameter estimate of the within-cluster slope (i.e., the autoregressive relationship). This is particularly relevant if the main question is whether there is on average an autoregressive effect. Nonetheless, we show that if the main interest is in estimating the effect of a level 2 predictor on the autoregressive parameter (i.e., a cross-level interaction), cluster mean centering should be preferred over other forms of centering. Hence, researchers should be clear on what is considered the main goal of their study, and base their choice of centering method on this when using a multilevel autoregressive model.},

Articles published in indexed periodicals between 1970 and 2008 were selected. From the inclusion/exclusion criteria 19 publications were selected in full for discussion. Of these, the majority were related to the health area and did not approach the concept of SWB directly, but touched on this together with the notions of wellbeing, satisfaction and quality of life. There were few publications that approached the term conceptually or that defined the instruments used for the assessment of SWB. Concluding, the results confirm the relevance of the theme for health promotion and the necessity of investigations related to the practices of health professionals.},

At baseline, 3 subgroups were identified with distinct within-person psychological profiles across cognitive, personality, and social integration constructs. Over time, highly similar subgroup profiles were found, and about two thirds of the participants could be classified as remaining in the same subgroups. Baseline subgroups differed in level and slope of change and in 2 outcomes, well-being and mortality. Independent of subgroup membership, subgroup-to-subgroup change was associated with greater decline and predicted poststudy mortality. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of a wholistic approach for long-term prediction of outcomes and within-person systemic variability.},

Another theory holds that we rather infer happiness on the basis of how well we feel most of the time. In that view, happiness is an unreasoned affective experience that roots in the gratification of universal human needs. One question that emerges from this discussion is whether these are really independent ways of evaluating life. If so, a next question is what their relative weight is in the evaluation. These questions are addressed at the nation level using data of the Gallup World Poll over the years 2006-2010. This survey in 127 nations involves not only a question on overall life satisfaction, but also a more cognitively focused question on how close one's life is to the best possible and a series of questions on yesterday's mood. Analysis of average scores in nations shows that mood and contentment are much inter-twined, but also add to overall life satisfaction independently, the former more than the latter.},

This review has two aims. One is to report on trends in life course research by focusing on empirical studies published since the year 2000. The other is to assess the overall development of the field. Major advances can be observed in four areas: national individual-level longitudinal databases, the impact of institutional contexts on life courses, life courses under conditions of societal ruptures, and health across the life course. In four other areas, advancements have been less pronounced: internal dynamics and causal linkages across life, the interaction of development and socially constructed life courses, theory development, and new methods. Overall, life course sociology still has far to go to reach its full potential.},

Increased recognition of the critical role played by assets in enhancing children's well-being has spurred efforts to study the relationship between assets and a range of outcomes for children. This chapter reviews current studies (i.e., conducted within the past 10 years) that explore the relationship between asset ownership and a range of outcomes. The studies we have included in this review illustrate the impact that assets can have on children's outcomes in the area of health, education, and child labor. Overall, the studies reviewed show that asset ownership improves children's health conditions, advance schooling outcomes, and decrease incidence of child labor. Further research on the asset effects for child outcomes can inform progressive asset-building initiatives that will provide impetus for programs and policies to enhance household well-being in developing countries.

	abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.},

In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the "within" estimate. Any matrix combination of the "within" and "between" estimates is generally biased. When the "within" estimate is subject to a relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different point of departure.},

As people now expect to live longer, they also seek continuing health and well-being throughout their extended old age. Occupational therapists are involved in working towards the attainment of well-being with their older clients. However, their understandings of what well-being for older people entails seems varied, as this examination of the occupational therapy and related gerontological literature reveals. RESULTS: Three key points emerge from the literature review: first, the definition of well-being is usually assumed, or is lacking in clarity, and a range of similar terms, such as happiness and life satisfaction, are used interchangeably; second, well-being has been measured in research using various scales, which may not capture the complexity of the concept; and third, the perspective of the older person is often missing in discussions of well-being. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is suggested that one way of moving occupational therapists' understanding of well-being forward is to conduct research into what older people themselves understand or perceive well-being to be.},

The Positive Psychology movement, along with changes in attitudes toward organisational and societal health, has generated a surge of interest in human happiness. The Oxford Handbook of Happiness is the definitive text for researchers and practitioners interested in human happiness. Its editors and chapter contributors are world leaders in the investigation of happiness across the fields of psychology, organizational behaviour, education, philosophy, social policy and economics. The study of happiness is at the nexus of four major scientific developments: the growing field of Positive Psychology which researches the conditions that make people flourish; advances in the biological and affective sciences which have contributed to the understanding of positive emotions; Positive Organizational Scholarship, an emerging discipline aimed at investigating and fostering excellence in organisations; and findings from economics indicating that traditional markers of economic and societal well-being are insufficient. The Oxford Handbook of Happiness offers readers a coherent, multi-disciplinary, and accessible text on the current state-of-the-art in happiness research. This volume features ten sections that focus on psychological, philosophical, evolutionary, economic and spiritual approaches to happiness; happiness in society, education, organisations and relationships; and the assessment and development of happiness. Readers will find information on psychological constructs such as resilience, flow, and emotional intelligence; theories including broaden-and-build and self-determination; and explorations of topics including collective virtuousness, psychological capital, coaching, environmental sustainability and economic growth. This handbook will be useful to academics, practitioners, teachers, students, and all those interested in theory and research on human happiness.},

A variation of this model was tested in a study of the separate as well as interactive effects of daily life events and personal strivings on psychological and physical well-being. Subjects listed 15 of their personal strivings, which were later categorized as reflecting either achievement, affiliation, intimacy, or power. For 21 consecutive days, subjects recorded up to eight events that most influenced their moods each day, and completed mood and physical symptom checklists. Power strivings were negatively correlated with well-being. Affiliation strivings were correlated with positive affect. No significant between-subject interactions occurred between strivings and events. However, within-subject analyses revealed several significant effects. Achievement-oriented individuals tended to be affected by good achievement events; similarly, the moods of affiliation- and intimacy-oriented individuals were affected by interpersonal events. Results are interpreted within a transactional framework, and implications for research on personality, life events, and well-being are discussed.},

The authors of the present study argue that this methodology is incomplete without a discussion of when the mixtures are needed and show that they only become relevant when constrained difference tests are conducted. Because constrained difference tests can hide important model misspecification, a reliable way to assess global model fit under constrained estimation would be needed. Examination of the options for assessing model fit under constrained estimation reveals that no perfect solutions exist, although the conditional approach of releasing a degree of freedom for each active constraint appears to be the most methodologically sound one. The authors discuss pros and cons of constrained and unconstrained estimation and their implementation in 5 popular structural equation modeling packages and argue that unconstrained estimation is a simpler method that is also more informative about sources of misfit. In practice, researchers will have trouble conducting constrained difference tests appropriately, as this requires a commitment to ignore Heywood cases. Consequently, mixture distributions for difference tests are rarely appropriate.},

In their model, the autoregressive relationships are modeled between the observed variables. This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter is invariant over time and lies between-1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters.},

The cross-sectional and longitudinal features of these studies were used to isolate age-related changes from confounding factors including instrumentation effects and cohort effects. Although estimated satisfaction trajectories varied somewhat across studies, two consistent findings emerged. First, both studies show that life satisfaction does not decline over much of adulthood. Second, there is a steep decline in life satisfaction among those older than 70. The British data also showed a relatively large increase in satisfaction from the 40s to the early 70s. Thus, age differences in well-being can be quite large and deserve increased empirical and theoretical attention.},

	abstract = {The question of whether there is a connection between income and psychological well-being is a long-studied issue across the social, psychological, and behavioral sciences. Much research has found that richer people tend to be happier. However, relatively little attention has been paid to whether happier individuals perform better financially in the first place. This possibility of reverse causality is arguably understudied. Using data from a large US representative panel, we show that adolescents and young adults who report higher life satisfaction or positive affect grow up to earn significantly higher levels of income later in life. We focus on earnings approximately one decade after the person's well-being is measured; we exploit the availability of sibling clusters to introduce family fixed effects; we account for the human capacity to imagine later socioeconomic outcomes and to anticipate the resulting feelings in current well-being. The study's results are robust to the inclusion of controls such as education, intelligence quotient, physical health, height, self-esteem, and later happiness. We consider how psychological well-being may influence income. Sobel-Goodman mediation tests reveal direct and indirect effects that carry the influence from happiness to income. Significant mediating pathways include a higher probability of obtaining a college degree, getting hired and promoted, having higher degrees of optimism and extraversion, and less neuroticism.},

	abstract = {When designing longitudinal studies, researchers often aim at equal intervals. In practice, however, this goal is hardly ever met, with different time intervals between assessment waves and different time intervals between individuals being more the rule than the exception. One of the reasons for the introduction of continuous time models by means of structural equation modelling has been to deal with irregularly spaced assessment waves (e.g., Oud \& Delsing, 2010). In the present paper we extend the approach to individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes. In addition, we show not only that equal intervals are unnecessary but also that it can be advantageous to use unequal sampling intervals, in particular when the sampling rate is low. Two examples are provided to support our arguments. In the first example we compare a continuous time model of a bivariate coupled process with varying time intervals to a standard discrete time model to illustrate the importance of accounting for the exact time intervals. In the second example the effect of different sampling intervals on estimating a damped linear oscillator is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. We conclude that it is important to account for individually varying time intervals, and encourage researchers to conceive of longitudinal studies with different time intervals within and between individuals as an opportunity rather than a problem.},

This method is found to be essentially a variation of the standard one with weaker supporting error analysis.},

Using the longitudinal data from a large national panel survey, the study found that consumers SWB influences spending on hedonic products via the mediating effects of their positive interpretation of life circumstances and broadened set of activities resulting from positive emotions. The results are explained using cognitive tuning theory and broaden-and-build theory and have implications for hedonic products providers in terms of who their target audience is and how demand for their products is generated.},

Linville(1987)proposed that SC serves as a cognitive buffer against extreme affective reactions to life events. We report results of two procedures: a classic meta-analysis and a more primitive vote-counting procedure. Overall, SC was negatively, but weakly, related to well-being, a relationship qualified by strong heterogeneity, among studies. We found little support for SC as a stress buffer, but more support as a moderator of uplifting events. Several methodological and substantive variables (e.g., the type of well-being studied, the valence of SC, and characteristics of the samples and designs used) were associated with effect magnitude. We discuss implications for competing theories of self-structure and comment on the use of information theory in studying the self.},

A structural equation perspective is used, showing that without an explicit measurement model relating indicators to latent variables and measurement errors, none of these conventional beliefs hold without qualifications. Moreover, a "causal" indicator model is presented that sometimes better corresponds to the relation of indicators to a construct than does the classical test theory "effect" indicator model.},

To demonstrate the respective strengths and weaknesses of the 2 approaches in representing these 2 aspects, we simulated data under (a) a cross-sectional common factor model, (b) a latent difference score model with random effects in intercept and slope, and (c) a bivariate dynamic factor analysis model with auto- and cross-regression parameters. Possible ways in which SEM and state-space modeling can be utilized as complementary tools in representing human developmental and other related processes are discussed.},

While previous studies have examined climatic influence by comparing the well-being of people living in different regions, this paper focuses on how daily changes in weather affect individuals living in a single location. The dataset consists of 516 days of data on 75 students from Osaka University. Daily information on outside events, as well as the daily physical condition and individual characteristics of the respondents, are used as controls. Subjective happiness is related to temperature: in a quadratic model, happiness is maximized at 13.9 degrees C. The effects of other meteorological variables humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and sunshine are not significant. The sensitivity of happiness to temperature also depends on attributes such as sex, age, and academic department. Happiness is more strongly affected by current temperature than by average temperature over the day. While enjoyment (a positive affect measure) is affected by weather in a similar way to happiness, sadness and depression (negative affect measures) behave somewhat differently.},

Because of the recent development of this technique, some issues critical to running an LDE model remain. In this article, the authors provide solutions to some of these issues and recommend a step-by-step procedure demonstrated on a set of empirical data, which models the interaction between ovarian hormone cycles and emotional eating. Results indicated that emotional eating is self-regulated. For instance, when people do more emotional eating than normal, they will subsequently tend to decrease their emotional eating behavior. In addition, a sudden increase will produce a stronger tendency to decrease than will a slow increase. We also found that emotional eating is coupled with the cycle of the ovarian hormone estradiol, and the peak of emotional eating occurs after the peak of estradiol. The self-reported average level of negative affect moderates the frequency of eating regulation and the coupling strength between eating and estradiol. Thus, people with a higher average level of negative affect tend to fluctuate faster in emotional eating, and their eating behavior is more strongly coupled with the hormone estradiol. Permutation tests on these empirical data supported the reliability of using LDE models to detect self-regulation and a coupling effect between two regulatory behaviors.},

Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of human monozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity data on 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratory activity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individual differences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roaming entropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively with individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show that factors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individual differences in structural brain plasticity and behavior. The paradigm introduced here serves as an animal model for identifying mechanisms of plasticity underlying nonshared environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior.
Identical and Still Different
Even in monozygotic twins reared together, there are always observable differences reflecting the influence of individual responses. Freund et al.

Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close.},

Wellbeing can be measured with affective (the amount of pleasant versus unpleasant experiences) and cognitive (satisfaction with life in general and life domains) measures. Since its inception 25 years ago, the SOEP has included cognitive measures of wellbeing. In 2007, the SOEP included four items (happy, sad, angry, afraid) as an affective measure of wellbeing. This paper examines similarities and differences between cognitive and affective measures of wellbeing. In the end, I propose a wellbeing index that combines information from measures of life satisfaction, average domain satisfaction, and affect balance.},

In line with our hypotheses, we found that Indian students reported less subjective well-being and emotional intelligence than German students. Emotional intelligence was associated with life satisfaction to a higher degree in Germany than in India. In Germany, independent but not interdependent self-construal was related to emotional intelligence; in India, both independent and interdependent self-construals were significantly associated with emotional intelligence. Results of structural equation modeling provided support for our hypotheses regarding mediational models in that the effect of emotional intelligence on life satisfaction was fully mediated by affect balance in Germany and by perceived social support in India.},

The online versions of this article have been corrected.] Prior research has documented associations between hours in child care and children{\textquoteright}s externalizing behavior. A series of longitudinal analyses were conducted to address 5 propositions, each testing the hypothesis that child care hours causes externalizing behavior. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were used in this investigation because they include repeated measures of child care experiences, externalizing behavior, and family characteristics. There were 3 main findings. First, the evidence linking child care hours with externalizing behavior was equivocal in that results varied across model specifications. Second, the association between child care hours and externalizing behavior was not due to a child effect. Third, child care quality and proportion of time spent with a large group of peers moderated the effects of child care hours on externalizing behavior. The number of hours spent in child care was more strongly related to externalizing behavior when children were in low-quality child care and when children spent a greater proportion of time with a large group of peers. The magnitude of associations between child care hours and externalizing behavior was modest. Implications are that parents and policymakers must take into account that externalizing behavior is predicted from a constellation of variables in multiple contexts.},

The models in the framework, called generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM), combine features of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and structural equation models (SEM) and consist of a response model and a structural model for the latent variables. The response model generalizes GLMMs to incorporate factor structures in addition to random intercepts and coefficients. As in GLMMs, the data can have an arbitrary number of levels and can be highly unbalanced with different numbers of lower-level units in the higher-level units and missing data. A wide range of response processes can be modeled including ordered and unordered categorical responses, counts, and responses of mixed types. The structural model is similar to the structural part of a SEM except that it may include latent and observed variables varying at different levels. For example, unit-level latent variables (factors or random coefficients) can be regressed on cluster-level latent variables. Special cases of this framework are explored and data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used for illustration. Maximum likelihood estimation and empirical Bayes latent score prediction within the GLLAMM framework can be performed using adaptive quadrature in gllamm, a freely available program running in Stata.},

	abstract = {Background Life events-like illness, marriage, or unemployment-have important effects on people. But there is no accepted way to measure the different sizes of these events upon human happiness and psychological health. By using happiness regression equations, economists have recently developed a method. Methods We estimate happiness regressions using large random samples of individuals. The relative coefficients of income and life events on happiness allow us to calculate a monetary 'compensating amount' for each kind of life event. Results The paper calculates the impact of different life events upon human well-being. Getting married, for instance, is calculated to bring each year the same amount of happiness, on average, as having an extra pound70 000 of income per annum. The psychological costs of losing a job greatly exceed those from the pure drop in income. Health is hugely important to happiness. Widowhood brings a degree of unhappiness that would take, on average, an extra pound170 000 per annum to offset. Well-being regressions also allow us to assess one of the oldest conjectures in social science-that well-being depends not just on absolute things but inherently on comparisons with other people. We find evidence for comparison effects. Conclusion We believe that the new statistical method has many applications. In principle, it can be used to value any kind of event in life.},

It can be used for removing noise from images and for small-area estimation. This paper presents the theory of BLUP, some examples of its application and its relevance to the foundations of statistics. Understanding of procedures for estimating random effects should help people to understand some complicated and controversial issues about fixed and random effects models and also help to bridge the apparent gulf between the Bayesian and Classical schools of thought.},

	abstract = {"Structural Equations with Latent Variables" is a comprehensive treatment of the general structural equation system better known as the LISREL model. The book serves three purposes. First, it demonstrates the generality of this model. Rather than treating path analysis, recursive and nonrecursive models, classical econometrics, and confirmatory factor analysis as unique, they are treated as special cases of a common model. The second purpose is to emphasize the application of these techniques. Empirical examples appear throughout. Several chapters contain some of the LISREL or EQS programs the author used to obtain the results for the empirical examples. Finally, the book explores the crucial role played by substantive expertise in most stages of the modeling process. "Structural Equations with Latent Variables" fills the gap existing in the treatment of this subject between introductory texts and specialized papers. It provides social scientists, market researchers, applied statisticians, other analysts, and graduate students with a thorough examination of LISREL/structural equation models. At the same time it presents new material on measurement reliability and validity, overall fit indices, model identification, and other topics.},

The first section of my paper is interpretive. I show how Haybron uses the concepts of 'central affective states' and 'mood propensity' to define happiness. The second and third sections of the paper are critical. They focus on the inclusion of mood propensity in Haybron's theory. In the second section I argue that his theory fails because there is an example that shows a subject can be happy even when that subject does not have a positive mood propensity. In the third section of the paper, I consider Haybron's objection that the case in question is 'object-specific' and that it is not 'emotionally-based'. I discuss both of these technical terms in detail. Moreover, I argue that a modified version of the counter example accommodates these technical terms while retaining the persuasiveness of the original example.},

In addition, we hypothesized that much of the weekend effect would be accounted for by the work versus nonwork contrast, given that work activities are expected to be associated with a lower sense of autonomy and relatedness than nonwork activities. Results supported these hypotheses, showing that for both male and female workers, weekend and nonwork activities were associated with several indicators of well-being, and these relations were partially or fully mediated by basic psychological need satisfaction.

	abstract = {Research has shown repeatedly that the "feeling better" effect of exercise is far more moderate than generally claimed. Examinations of subgroups in secondary analyses also indicate that numerous further variables influence this relationship. One reason for inconsistencies in this research field is the lack of adequate theoretical analyses. Well-being output variables frequently possess no construct definition, and little attention is paid to moderating and mediating variables. This article integrates the main models in an overview and analyzes how secondary analyses define well-being and which areas of the construct they focus on. It then applies a moderator and/or mediator framework to examine which person and environmental variables can be found in the existing explanatory approaches in sport science and how they specify the influence of these moderating and mediating variables. Results show that the broad understanding of well-being in many secondary analyses makes findings difficult to interpret. Moreover, physiological explanatory approaches focus more on affective changes in well-being, whereas psychological approaches also include cognitive changes. The approaches focus mostly on either physical or psychological person variables and rarely combine the two, as in, for example, the dual-mode model. Whereas environmental variables specifying the treatment more closely (e.g., its intensity) are comparatively frequent, only the social support model formulates variables such as the framework in which exercise is presented. The majority of explanatory approaches use simple moderator and/or mediator models such as the basic mediated (e.g., distraction hypothesis) or multiple mediated (e.g., monoamine hypotheses) model. The discussion draws conclusions for future research.},

We used 10-wave interview data of 503 boys, their primary caregivers, and their teachers. Our first aim was to unravel the direction of effects between parent{\textendash}child relationships and children's offending. Cross-lagged panel models revealed bidirectional links over time between poorer quality parent{\textendash}child relationships and boys' offending across late childhood (age 7{\textendash}10), early adolescence (age 10{\textendash}13) and middle adolescence (age 13{\textendash}16). Second, we examined the associations between mean changes in delinquency, on the one hand, and mean changes in relationship quality, on the other hand. Although parent{\textendash}child relationships improved during childhood, their quality decreased in early adolescence and remained stable in middle adolescence. Delinquency increased only in middle adolescence. In five out of six models, the slope factors of relationship quality and offending were strongly correlated, indicating that stronger increases in delinquency were associated with stronger decreases in parent{\textendash}child relationship quality across childhood, early adolescence, and middle adolescence. The discussion focuses on the theoretical implications of these two types of longitudinal associations.},

Hence, a systematic bibliographic review was conducted, aiming to find possible subjective mediators between social variables derived from changes and emotional wellbeing. The results of the review show that subjective mediators such as locus of control, perceived control, self-efficacy beliefs, perceived familial support, and the subjective evaluation of social change explain part of the relationship between macrosocial changes and emotional wellbeing. Results appear coherent with proposed multidimensional models of social change and mental health, although further research should be conducted to determine the specific weight of these phenomena in individual emotional wellbeing.},

The approach also allows for direct estimation of power, where effect size is defined in terms of a null and alternative value of the root-mean-square error of approximation fit index proposed by J. H. Steiger and J. M. Lind (1980). It is also feasible to determine minimum sample size required to achieve a given level of power for any test of fit in this framework.

	abstract = {Haavelmo's seminal 1943 paper is the first rigorous treatment of causality. In it, he distinguished the definition of causal parameters from their identification. He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) used in one influential recent approach to causality (Pearl, 2000) and in the related literature on Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare an approach based on Haavelmo's methodology with a standard approach in the causal literature of DAGs{\textendash} the "do-calculus" of Pearl (2009). We discuss the limitations of DAGs and in particular of the do-calculus of Pearl in securing identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo (1944). In general cases, DAGs cannot be used to analyze models for simultaneous causality, but Haavelmo's approach naturally generalizes to cover it.},

The theory, which has gained widespread acceptance in recent years, implies that individual and societal efforts to increase happiness are doomed to failure. The recent empirical work outlined here indicates that 5 important revisions to the treadmill model are needed. First, individuals' set points are not hedonically neutral. Second, people have different set points, which are partly dependent on their temperaments. Third, a single person may have multiple happiness set points: Different components of well-being such as pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions, and life satisfaction can move in different directions. Fourth, and perhaps most important, well-being set points can change under some conditions. Finally, individuals differ in their adaptation to events, with some individuals changing their set point and others not changing in reaction to some external event. These revisions offer hope for psychologists and policy-makers who aim to decrease human misery and increase happiness.},

Current research on well-being has been derived from two general perspectives: the hedonic approach, which focuses on happiness and defines well-being in terms of pleasure attainment and pain avoidance; and the eudaimonic approach, which focuses on meaning and self-realization and defines well-being in terms of the degree to which a person is fully functioning. These two views have given rise to different research foci and a body of knowledge that is in some areas divergent and in others complementary. New methodological developments concerning multilevel modeling and construct comparisons are also allowing researchers to formulate new questions for the field. This review considers research from both perspectives concerning the nature of well-being, its antecedents, and its stability across time and culture.},

Experiment 1 demonstrated that thinking about. one's income as an hourly wage reduced the happiness that participants derived from leisure time on the internet. Experiment 2 revealed that a similar manipulation decreased participants' state of happiness after listening to a pleasant song and that this effect was fully mediated by the degree of impatience experienced during the music. Finally. Experiment 3 showed that the deleterious effect on happiness caused by impatience was attenuated by offering participants monetary compensation in exchange for time spent listening to music, suggesting that a sensation of unprofitably wasted time underlay the induced impatience. Together these experiments establish that thinking about time in terms of money can influence how people experience pleasurable events by instigating greater impatience during unpaid time.

Generally accepted ways to aggregate data in the course of empirically studying relationships simply ignore idiosyncrasy{\textendash}but do so at some as yet undetermined costs.

	abstract = {Background The paradigm shift from the clinically deficit-oriented approach to that of educationally strength-based model in assessing adolescents' psychosocial well-being has brought about a recent increase in school-based health promotion and prevention initiatives. This prompted this systematic review of measuring instruments designed to assess psychosocial well-being of children and adolescents. Methods Using electronic databases on Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, PROQUEST, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus and Psychosocial and Health Instrument, a systematic review of literature of measuring instruments was conducted from their inception to December 2009 using the keywords of child, emotion, assessment, scale and measure. Measuring instruments from selected articles were critically appraised using a predetermined set of quality indicators which guided the rating of the psychometric properties of the instruments into grades of A, B, and C. The constructs of psychosocial well-being from the measuring instruments were categorized into themes. Results Twenty-nine out of the 908 articles met the inclusion criteria. Seventeen instruments identified from the selected articles were examined using preset quality indicators. In construct building, the themes identified from the strength-based instruments distinguished the construct of psychosocial well-being primarily into the dimensions of personal emotional competency and social functioning. In the ratings of psychometric properties, one instrument was rated 5A, five rated 4A and four rated 3A. For reliability testing, eight measures received grade A when their intraclass correlation is higher than 0.7; whereas only two instruments reported sensitivity and none investigated responsiveness. Conclusions Strength-based measures focusing on social emotional behavioural outcomes open up a possibility to link up assessment with promotion of psychosocial well-being, away from clinical settings and into adolescents' homes, schools and community. Future research should focus more on investigating the sensitivity and responsiveness of measuring instruments using longitudinal design in efficacy studies to assess change in adolescents' psychosocial status over extended time.},

	abstract = {The assessment of health-related quality of life:(HR-QOL)is an essential element of healthcare evaluation. Hundreds of generic and specific HR-QOL instruments have been developed. Generic HR-QOL instruments are designed to be applicable across a wide range of populations and interventions. Specific HR-QOL measures are designed to be relevant to particular interventions or in certain subpopulations (e.g. individuals with rheumatoid arthritis). This review examines 7 generic HR-QOL instruments: (i) the Medical Out-comes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) health survey; (ii) the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), (iii) the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP); (iv) the Dartmouth Primary care Cooperative Information Project (COOP) Charts; (v) the Quality of Well-Beings (QWB) Scale; (vi) the Health Utilities Index (HUI); and (vii) the EuroQol Instrument (EQ-5D). These instruments were selected because they are commonly used and/or cited in the English language literature. The 6 characteristics of an instrument addressed by this review are: (i) conceptual and measurement model; (ii) reliability; (iii) validity; (iv) respondent and administrative burden; (v) alternative forms; and (vi) cultural and language adaptations. Of the instruments reviewed, the SF-36 health survey is the most commonly used HR-QOL measure. It was developed as a short-form measure of functioning and well-being in the Medical Outcomes Study. The Dartmouth COOP Charts were designed to be used in everyday clinical practice to provide immediate feedback to clinicians about the health status of their patients. The NHP was developed to reflect lay rather than professional perceptions of health. The SLP was constructed as a measure of sickness in relation to impact on behaviour. The QWB, HUI and EQ-5D art: preference-based measures designed to summarise HR-QOL in a single number ranging from 0 to i. We found that there are no uniformly 'worst' or 'best' performing instruments. The decision to use one over another, to use a combination of 2 or more, to use a profile and/or a preference-based measure or to use a generic measure along with a targeted measure will be driven by the purpose of the measurement. Ln addition, the choice will depend on a variety of factors including the characteristics of the population (e.g. age, health status, language/culture) and the environment in which the measurement is undertaken (e.g. clinical trial, routine physician visit). We provide our summary of the level of evidence in the literature regarding each instrument's characteristics based on the review criteria. The potential user of these instruments should base their instrument selection decision on the characteristics that are most relevant to their par particular HR-QOL measurement needs.},

Different criteria correlated with each subscale: PAS correlated positively with morale and avowed happiness, while NAS correlated with poorer mental health and greater role loss. The pattern of correlations indicated that ABS was the best over-all measure of psychological well-being. Further empirical support for the two-dimensional base of the ABS was indicated by the non-significant correlation between PAS and NAS. While the ABS is applicable to an aged population, differential age norms should be developed to increase further its utility in comparing various age groups and age-related change.},

The scale provides a single psychological well-being score. The measure has good psychometric properties, and is strongly associated with other psychological well-being scales. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience produces a score for positive feelings (6 items), a score for negative feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create a balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative emotions. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the amount of time the feelings were experienced during the past 4 weeks. The scale converges well with measures of emotions and affective well-being.},

The subjective well-being approach is mainly based on German panel data for the period 1984-2009 (German Socio-Economic Panel), while the survey experimental approach is based on a tailor-made experimental design conducted among Swedish adults. Our analysis suggests that the degree of positional concerns is not homogenous across the life cycle. Our different analytical approaches show a robust life cycle pattern of positional concerns: young people experience no or a low degree of positional concerns, yet the level of concerns for income increases gradually and significantly with age. The results also differ across goods: while car consumption is similar to income, the positional concern for leisure time decreases through the life cycle. Tables, Appendixes, References.},

	abstract = {Using data from 4 waves of an Australian panel study, this study offers a dynamic account of relations between personality, life events, and subjective well-being (SWB). Members of the Victorian Quality of Life panel study were interviewed in 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1987. The initial sample size was 942; 649 respondents remain. The study shows that very stable personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience) predispose people to experience moderately stable levels of favorable and adverse life events and moderately stable levels of SWB. However, contrary to previous research (P. T. Costa and R. R. McCrae, 1984) life events influence SWB over and above the effects of personality. A dynamic equilibrium (DE) model is outlined, in which each person is regarded as having "normal" equilibrium levels of life events and SWB, predictable on the basis of age and personality. Only when events deviate from their equilibrium levels does SWB change. The DE model is compared with 3 alternatives: personality models, adaptation level models, and models that treat life events as being wholly exogenous.},

	abstract = {Factor score estimation is a controversial topic in psychometrics, and the estimation of factor scores from exploratory factor models has historically received a great deal of attention. However, both confirmatory factor models and the existence of missing data have generally been ignored in this debate. This article presents a simulation study that compares the reliability of sum scores, regression-based and expected posterior methods for factor score estimation for confirmatory factor models in the presence of missing data. Although all methods perform reasonably well with complete data, expected posterior-weighted (full) maximum likelihood methods are significantly more reliable than sum scores and regression estimators in the presence of missing data. Factor score reliability for complete data can be predicted by  formula for factor communality. Furthermore, factor score reliability for incomplete data can be reasonably approximated by communality raised to the 
11-P(Missing) power. An empirical demonstration shows that the full maximum likelihood method best preserves the relationship between nicotine dependence and a genetic predictor under missing data. Implications and recommendations for applied research are discussed.},

This finding was corroborated by self-and peer reports in Study 1 and replicated in Study 2. The validity of the scales was established by the convergence of self- and peer ratings. Moreover, Study 2 showed that dysfunctional and functional self-consciousness scales suppressed variance in attention to feelings, thereby revealing that attention incorporates both adaptive and maladaptive aspects.},

In Experiment 1 86 undergraduates rated their life satisfaction (five scales forming the Satisfaction With Life Scale), happiness on five rating scales, and valence and activation of current mood, each on three rating scales, before and after attending a lecture. The results showed that happiness was related to life satisfaction mediated by valence of current mood. The change in happiness from before to after attending the lecture was only influenced by the change in valence of the current mood. In Experiment 2 which used scenarios to induce valence and activation of current mood in four randomized groups with a total of 135 undergraduates, happiness was related to preference for current mood rated on three scales which in turn was directly affected by both the valence and activation induction. Valence was in the mood-induction scenarios related to the expected rate of goal pursuit and activation to incidental events. Experiment 3 demonstrated for another 59 undergraduates that happiness stayed related to preference for a positive mood despite that its relation to a positive mood was reversed in an incongruent situation.},

	abstract = {Objective: To review systematically prospective, observational, cohort studies of the association between positive well-being and mortality using meta-analytic methods. Recent years have witnessed increased interest in the relationship between positive psychological well-being and physical health. Methods: We searched general bibliographic databases: Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed up to January 2008. Two reviewers independently extracted data on Study characteristics, quality, and estimates of associations. Results: There were 35 studies (26 articles) investigating mortality in initially healthy Populations and 35 studies (28 articles) of disease populations. The meta-analyses showed that positive psychological well-being was associated with reduced mortality in both the healthy population (combined hazard ratio (HR) = 0.82; 95\% Confidence Interval (Cl) = 0.76-0.89; p {\textless} .001) and the disease Population (combined FIR = 0.98; CI = 0.95-1.00; p = .030) studies. There were indications Of publication bias in this literature, although the fail-safe numbers were 2444 and 1397 for healthy and disease Population studies,, respectively. Intriguingly, meta-analysis of studies that controlled for negative affect showed that the protective effects of positive psychological well-being were independent of negative affect. Both positive affect (e.g., emotional well-being, positive mood, joy, happiness, vigor, energy) and positive trait-like dispositions (e.g., life satisfaction, hopefulness, optimism, sense of humor) were associated with reduced mortality in healthy population Studies. Positive psychological well-being was significantly associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in healthy population studies, and with reduced death rates in patients with renal failure and with human immunodeficiency virus-infection. Conclusions: The Current review suggests that positive psychological well-being has a favorable effect on survival in both healthy and diseased populations.},

Researchers using subjective well-being data should be aware of the potential biasing effects of the weather on their estimates. In this paper, the responsiveness of well-being to climate and transitory weather conditions is investigated by analyzing subjective well-being data collected in the Princeton Affect and Time Survey. General satisfaction questions about life in general, life at home, health and one's job, as well as questions concerning feelings intensities during specific episodes are studied. Women are much more responsive than men to the weather, and life satisfaction decreases with the amount of rain on the day of the interview. Low temperatures increase happiness and reduce tiredness and stress, raising net affect, and high temperatures reduce happiness, consistent with the fact that the survey was conducted in the summer. Methods to reduce the possible biases are suggested in the conclusion.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to analyze the influence of the weather on a person{\textquoteright}s self-reported life satisfaction. On a theoretical level, it is claimed that {\textquoteleft}nice{\textquoteright} weather can improve the affective well-being of a person. Given this, it is argued that affects can, in turn, have an impact on that person{\textquoteright}s general assessment of his or her life. In particular, it is expected that people would report a higher life satisfaction on days with unambiguously {\textquoteleft}nice{\textquoteright} weather. Data from three German large-scale surveys are used to test empirically to what extent self-reported life satisfaction is determined by the weather. All in all, the results are mostly consistent with the initial hypothesis. In all three samples those respondents surveyed on days with exceptionally sunny weather reported a higher life satisfaction compared to respondents interviewed on days with {\textquoteleft}ordinary{\textquoteright} weather. In two out of three samples, this difference was statistically significant. Hence, the supposed sunshine effect on peoples{\textquoteright} life satisfaction does indeed exist. Implications of these findings are discussed in a conclusion.},

Traditional factor analysis is exploratory in nature, while SFA is confirmatory. New SFA techniques permit hypothesis testing, are more communicative and readily available, and form a subset of linear structural relations models which have altered methods of data collection and analysis. The conceptual differences between traditional factor analysis and SFA are highlighted by examining procedures of model specification, estimation and testing. Advanced SFA models, such as latent variable path analysis, multiple group factor analyses and longitudinal growth curve analyses, are described. However, SFA methods have several limitations, common to most other techniques of data analyses: They require good samplings of Ss, variables and models; involve complicated computations; and do not choose appropriate models.},

It does so by examining whether daily fluctuations in co-workers' support (i.e., a typical job resource) and daily fluctuations in work/family conflict (i.e., a typical job demand) predict day-levels of job satisfaction and mental health through work engagement and exhaustion, respectively. A total of 61 schoolteachers completed a general questionnaire and a daily survey over a period of five consecutive work days. Multilevel analyses provided evidence for both the above processes. Consistently with the hypotheses, our results showed that day-level work engagement mediated the impact of day-level co-workers' support on day-level job satisfaction and day-level mental health, after general levels of work engagement and outcome variables had been controlled for. Moreover, day-level exhaustion mediated the relationship between day-level work/family conflict and day-level job satisfaction and day-level mental health after general levels of exhaustion and outcome variables had been controlled for. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic psychological processes that determine daily fluctuations in employee well-being. Such insights may be transformed into job redesign strategies and other interventions designed to enhance work-related psychological well-being on a daily level.},

Many researchers have set a clear path between physical exercise and feeling better or the connection of reduced physical activity and diminished health. Nevertheless the allusive subjective psychological construct of well-being has not been directly connected to physical activity. Despite abundance of technical evidence that supports notions of correlations between physical exercise and well-being, the scientific proof is not within our reach yet. Some of the basic reasons are the facts that the definition of well-being is unclear, not many RCT's (Randomized Control Trials) have been performed, dose related results are scarce and many articles use small populations and different methodology. Until an actual research based connection will be found between physical exercise and well-being, the authors strongly recommend physical activity as part of everyone's leisure time, since there are enough proven physical mental, and social benefits to physical activity besides well-being.},

	abstract = {The authors review the contribution of qualitative methods to exploring concepts and experiences of wellbeing among children and adults living in developing countries. They provide examples illustrating the potential of these methods for gaining a holistic and contextual understanding of people's perceptions and experiences. Some of these come from Young Lives, an innovative long-term international research project investigating the changing nature of child poverty in India, Ethiopia, Peru and Vietnam ({\textgreater}http://www.younglives.org.uk), and others from the Wellbeing in Developing Countries ESRC research group (WeD), an international, inter-disciplinary project exploring the social and cultural construction of wellbeing in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand (http://www.welldev.org.uk). The authors show how qualitative methods can be used both alongside and as part of the development of sensitive and relevant quantitative measures, and provide some practical and methodological recommendations. They propose that qualitative approaches are essential in understanding people's experiences of wellbeing, both now and in the future. However, the authors caution that while these offer many benefits, for example, a less structured and hierarchical engagement between researcher and participant; they require time, energy, and sensitivity. Qualitative methods also work best when used by trained and experienced researchers working in the local language/s in a community where some rapport has already been established. Finally, the paper recommends combining data from qualitative and quantitative approaches (e.g. psychological measures or household surveys) to enhance its explanatory power.},

The hypotheses by Stones and Kozma were confirmed with the first two factors from the Affect Intensity Measure Simplified (AIMS).

While these goals have yielded much-needed health improvements, the subjective outcomes of these improvements, as experienced by individuals and the communities, have not been considered. Bhutan, under the overarching policy of Gross National Happiness, has provided due consideration to these subjective indicators. Here, we report on the current status of health and happiness in Bhutan as revealed by conventional objective indicators and subjective Gross National Happiness indicators. The current literature on health in Bhutan in relation to the Gross National Happiness Survey conducted by the Centre of Bhutan Studies has been reviewed. Bhutan has made great strides within a short period of modernization, as shown by both objective and subjective indicators. Tremendous challenges lie ahead to achieve the ultimate goal of health and happiness, and how Bhutan articulates its path to modernization may be a lesson for the rest of the world.},

This research provides evidence that recurring events may also elicit anticipatory mood changes, and that both reactive and anticipatory mood responses need to be considered when studying affective experiences and emotion regulation. Based on prevalent theories on emotion regulation, we propose that anticipatory and reactive mood responses to recurring unpleasant events may change throughout adulthood, reflecting an age-related shift in emotion-regulation priorities. An unpleasant (monotonous) face-rating task across 10 100-min sessions was completed by 154 participants aged 20 to 81 years. Positive mood was assessed before and after each session. Almost all participants experienced a decline in positive mood while working on the task. However, in contrast to younger adults who showed a rapid drop in pretask mood in line with previous experience, older adults maintained their positive pretask mood across several sessions, suggesting a shift from anticipatory mood adjustment to positive mood maintenance with advancing adult age.},

Results also revealed that autonomy support, defined as the ability to perceive oneself as the source of one's behavior, was a significant and positive predictor of life satisfaction. To address some of the limitations from study I, study II used the World Values Survey to examine the effects of autonomy support on life satisfaction and domain satisfaction among representative samples from Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. The findings showed that the autonomy support was a significant predictor of life satisfaction and domain satisfaction in all three countries. The implications of the results are discussed.},

These intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are ideal for examining complex change over time but present new challenges that illustrate the need for more advanced analytic methods. For example, in ILD the temporal spacing of observations may be irregular, and individuals may be sampled at different times. Also, it is important to assess both how the outcome changes over time and the variation between participants{\textquoteright} time-varying processes to make inferences about a particular intervention{\textquoteright}s effectiveness within the population of interest. The methods presented in this article integrate 2 innovative ILD analytic techniques: functional data analysis and dynamical systems modeling. An empirical application is presented using data from a smoking cessation clinical trial. Study participants provided 42 daily assessments of pre-quit and post-quit withdrawal symptoms. Regression splines were used to approximate smooth functions of craving and negative affect and to estimate the variables{\textquoteright} derivatives for each participant. We then modeled the dynamics of nicotine craving using standard input{\textendash}output dynamical systems models. These models provide a more detailed characterization of the post-quit craving process than do traditional longitudinal models, including information regarding the type, magnitude, and speed of the response to an input. The results, in conjunction with standard engineering control theory techniques, could potentially be used by tobacco researchers to develop a more effective smoking intervention.},

The evidence suggests that poor health, separation, unemployment and lack of social contact are all strongly negatively associated with SWB. However, the review highlights a range of problems in drawing firm conclusions about the causes of SWB; these include some contradictory evidence, concerns over the impact on the findings of potentially unobserved variables and the lack of certainty on the direction of causality.

	abstract = {Multivariate time series data offer researchers opportunities to study dynamics of various systems in social and behavioral sciences. Dynamic factor model (DFM), as an idiographic approach for studying intraindividual variability and dynamics, has typically been applied to time series data obtained from a single unit. When multivariate time series data are collected from multiple units, how to synchronize dynamical information becomes a silent issue. To address this issue, the current study presented a multilevel dynamic factor model (MDFM) that analyzes multiple multivariate time series in multilevel SEM frameworks. MDFM not only disentangles within- and between-person variability but also models dynamics of the intraindividual processes. To illustrate the uses of MDFMs, we applied lag0, lag1, and lag2 MDFMs to empirical data on affect collected from 205 dating couples who had at least 50 consecutive days of observations. We also considered a model extension where the dynamical coefficients were allowed to be randomly varying in the population. The empirical analysis yielded interesting findings regarding affect regulation and coregulation within couples, demonstrating promising uses of MDFMs in analyzing multiple multivariate time series. In the end, we discussed a number of methodological issues in the applications of MDFMs and pointed out possible directions for future research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Direct reports of subjective well-being may have a useful role in the measurement of consumer preferences and social welfare, if they can be done in a credible way. Can well-being be measured by a subjective survey, even approximately? In this paper, we discuss research on how individuals' responses to subjective well-being questions vary with their circumstances and other factors. We will argue that it is fruitful to distinguish among different conceptions of utility rather than presume to measure a single, unifying concept that motivates all human choices and registers all relevant feelings and experiences. While various measures of well-being are useful for some purposes, it is important to recognize that subjective well-being measures features of individuals' perceptions of their experiences, not their utility as economists typically conceive of it. Those perceptions are a more accurate gauge of actual feelings if they are reported closer to the time of, and in direct reference to, the actual experience. We conclude by proposing the U- index, a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, and has the virtue of not requiring a cardinal conception of individuals' feelings.},

However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models. One is the choice of which to apply; another is that FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible. For example, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time. The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others. Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary. Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare. This article presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases. In addition, it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics. Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models software.},

For both models, the authors demonstrated that cross-sectional approaches to mediation typically generate substantially biased estimates of longitudinal parameters even under the ideal conditions when mediation is complete. In longitudinal models where variable M completely mediates the effect of X on Y, cross-sectional estimates of the direct effect of X on Y, the indirect effect of X on Y through M, and the proportion of the total effect mediated by M are often highly misleading.},

On the other hand, negative affective cues are hypothesized to encourage item-specific processing at encoding, which should discourage such effects. The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with these predictions: Individuals in negative moods were significantly less likely to show false memory effects than those in positive moods or those whose mood was not manipulated. Experiment 2 introduced inclusion instructions to investigate whether moods had their effects at encoding or retrieval. The results replicated the false memory finding of Experiment 1 and provide evidence that moods influence the accessibility of lures at encoding, rather than influencing monitoring at retrieval of whether lures were actually presented.},

This review updates and expands a previous review of the child well-being literature spanning 1974-1992. Results indicate that well-being is a commonly used but inconsistently defined term frequently included in the study of child development. There are five distinct domains of child well-being: physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and economic. Positive indicators are used more often in the physical, cognitive, social, and economic domains, while more negative or deficit indicators are used in the psychological domain.

The rationale for each technique is reviewed, followed by Monte Carlo analysis based on a three-wave simulation of organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Parameter estimates and standard errors for each MDT are contrasted with complete-data estimates, under three mechanisms of missingness (completely random, random, and nonrandom) and three levels of missingness (25\%, 50\%, and 75\%; all monotone missing). Results support maximum likelihood and MI approaches, which particularly outperform listwise deletion for parameters involving many recouped cases. Better standard error estimates are derived from FIML and MI techniques. All MDTs perform worse when data are missing nonrandomly.},

	abstract = {Background: Promoting the mental well-being of older people has been neglected. Aim: To examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of exercise and physical activity interventions on mental well-being in people aged 65+. Design: Systematic review, meta-analysis, economic model. Methods: Reports published in English, identified by searching 25 databases, 11 websites and references lists of systematic reviews. Eligible studies were those with a comparison or control group or offering qualitative evidence; exercise and physical activity interventions for people aged 65 and above living at home, in the community, in supported housing or in residential care homes; including outcome measures of mental well-being, not simply measures of depression or anxiety. Low-quality studies were excluded from the data synthesis. Results: An overall effect of exercise on mental well-being was found (standardised effect size = 0.27; CI = 0.14-0.40). The included interventions were designed for older people, targeted those who are sedentary and delivered in a community setting, primarily through a group-based approach led by trained leaders. As a minimum, the evidence would suggest two exercise sessions per week, each of 45 min duration. There is some indication that exercise can also improve the mental well-being of frail elders. Economic evidence indicated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (compared with minimal intervention) of 7300 pound and 12,100 pound per quality adjusted life year gained for community-based walking and exercise programmes, respectively. Conclusions: Mental well-being in later life is modifiable through exercise and physical activity. To generalise the findings, there is a need for more evidence of effectiveness from older people in the UK.},

Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling{\textemdash}correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals{\textemdash}is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Pl{\"u}mper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.},

Participants responded to five to seven random prompts/day for 7 consecutive days; when prompted, participants rated eight mood adjectives assessing positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Global depressed mood was also assessed via self-report questionnaire at every wave. Mixed-effects regression analyses indicated that PA modestly but significantly declined across Grade 8 to 11, but NA was relatively stable over time. Sex by time interactions showed that boys experienced greater declines in daily mood over time than did girls. In contrast, global depressed mood did not change over time, and girls reported higher depressed mood than boys. Findings suggest that normative mood declines in adolescence may be driven by deteriorations in PA, rather than increases in NA.},

However, this interaction was only found for core-self evaluations and beliefs about mood repair. Our findings provide some preliminary support for a specific interaction between a broad personality construct and beliefs about mood repair in explaining levels of happiness.

We hypothesize that eliciting the cognitive component by means of life-satisfaction judgments activates thoughts about positive and negative life circumstances that influence the affective component (current mood or memory of the frequency of past positive and negative affects). Experiment 1 demonstrates an expected asymmetrical carryover effect in that current mood correlates higher with life-satisfaction judgments performed before than after the measurements of current mood. In Experiment 2, it is found that inducing current mood by means of rewarding performance does not influence the life-satisfaction judgments. In contrast and consistent with Experiment 1, Experiment 3 shows such an influence when current mood is induced by thinking about positive and negative life circumstances.},

	abstract = {Recently, the large T panel literature has emphasized unobserved, time-varying heterogeneity that may stem from omitted common variables or global shocks that affect each individual unit differently. These latent common factors induce cross-section dependence and may lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates if they are correlated with the explanatory variables. Moreover, if the process underlying these factors is nonstationary, the individual regressions will be spurious but pooling or averaging across individual estimates still permits consistent estimation of a long-run coefficient. The need to tackle both error cross-section dependence and persistent autocorrelation is motivated by the evidence of their pervasiveness found in three well-known, international finance and macroeconomic examples. A range of estimators is surveyed and their finite-sample properties are examined by means of Monte Carlo experiments. These reveal that a mean group version of the common-correlated-effects estimator stands out as the most robust since it is the preferred choice in rather general (non) stationary settings where regressors and errors share common factors and their factor loadings are possibly dependent. Other approaches which perform reasonably well include the two-way fixed effects, demeaned mean group and between estimators but they are less efficient than the common-correlated-effects estimator.},

Under this condition, hypotheses about the nature of sociocultural differences and similarities can be confidently and meaningfully tested among the constructs' moments in each sociocultural sample. Some of the issues involved in making such tests are reviewed and explicated within the framework of multiple-group mean and covariance structures analyses.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The Likert scale is very popular, but the question as to the number of scale points is still controversial. This article studies the differences among 4-, 5-, 6-, and 11-point Likert scales with a sample of 1,217 students in Macau, using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale as the measuring instrument. There is no major difference in internal structure in terms of means, standard deviations, item{\textendash}item correlations, item{\textendash}total correlations, Cronbach's alpha, or factor loadings. Findings indicate that having more scale points seems to reduce skewness, and the 11-point scale, ranging from 0 to 10, has the smallest kurtosis and is closest to normal. Only the 6- and 11-point scales follow normal distributions from Kolmogorov{\textendash}Smirnov and Shapiro{\textendash}Wilk statistics. Results on predictive validity are inconclusive. This article discusses future applications and suggests the use of an 11-point scale as it increases sensitivity and is closer to interval level of scaling and normality. Recommendations for social workers and teachers are made to better assist when using self-reported measurement scales.},

The aim of this paper is to formulate a conceptual framework of associations between urban green space, and ecosystem and human health. Through an interdisciplinary literature review the concepts of Green Infrastructure, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being are discussed. The possible contributions of urban and peri-urban green space systems, or Green Infrastructure, on both ecosystem and human health are critically reviewed. Finally, based on a synthesis of the literature a conceptual framework is presented. The proposed conceptual framework highlights many dynamic factors, and their complex interactions, affecting ecosystem health and human health in urban areas. This framework forms the context into which extant and new research can be placed. In this way it forms the basis for a new interdisciplinary research agenda. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Participants answered six questionnaires, two of which were used for another study. All of the tests were of Japanese versions and were answered with regard to the previous week's experiences. Results showed that LS was positively associated with PA and negatively with NA, but that the positive association was stronger for activated PA than deactivated PA, while the negative association was stronger for deactivated NA than activated NA. Furthermore, an interactive effect between deactivated NA and ES on LS was significant in men, where post hoc tests demonstrated that deactivated NA was more negatively associated with LS when ES was higher.

	abstract = {We present a revision of latent state-trait (LST-R) theory with new definitions of states and traits. This theory applies whenever we study the consistency of behavior, its variability, and its change over time. States and traits are defined in terms of probability theory. This allows for a seamless transition from theory to statistical modeling of empirical data. LST-R theory not only gives insights into the nature of latent variables but it also takes into account four fundamental facts: Observations are fallible, they never happen in a situational vacuum, they are always made using a specific method of observations, and there is no person without a past. Although the first fact necessitates considering measurement error, the second fact requires allowances for situational fluctuations. The third fact implies that, in the first place, states and traits are method specific. Furthermore, compared to the previous version of LST theory (see, e.g., Steyer et al. 1992, 1999), our revision is based on the notion of a person-at-time-t. The new definitions in LST-R theory have far-reaching implications that not only concern the properties of states, traits, and the associated concepts of measurement errors and state residuals, but also are related to the analysis of states and traits in longitudinal observational and intervention studies.

A difficulty with research on this issue is that there are likely to be omitted cohort effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times). First, using data on 500,000 randomly sampled Americans and West Europeans, the paper designs a test that can control for cohort effects. Holding other factors constant, we show that a typical individual's happiness reaches its minimum - on both sides of the Atlantic and for both males and females - in middle age. Second, evidence is provided for the existence of a similar U-shape through the life-course in East European, Latin American and Asian nations. Third, a U-shape in age is found in separate well-being regression equations in 72 developed and developing nations. Fourth, using measures that are closer to psychiatric scores, we document a comparable well-being curve across the life cycle in 2 other data sets (1) in GHQ-N6 mental health levels among a sample of 16,000 Europeans, and (2) in reported depression-and-anxiety levels among 1 million UK citizens. Fifth, we discuss some apparent exceptions, particularly in developing nations, to the U-shape. Sixth, we note that American male birth-cohorts seem to have become progressively less content with their lives. Our results are based on regression equations in which other influences, such as demographic variables and income, are held constant. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Despite the apparent simplicity of this tripartite model, the structure of SWB remains in question. In the present review, the authors identify five prominent structural conceptualizations in which SWB is cast variously as three separate components, a hierarchical construct, a causal system, a composite, and as configurations of components. Supporting evidence for each of these models is reviewed, strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, and commonalities and discrepancies among approaches are described. The authors demonstrate how current ambiguities concerning the tripartite structure of SWB have fundamental implications for conceptualization, measurement, analysis, and synthesis. Given these ambiguities, it is premature to propose a definitive structure of SWB. Rather, the authors outline a research agenda comprising both short-term and longer-term steps toward resolving these foundational, yet largely unaddressed, issues concerning SWB.},

This study examined the determinants of daily mood variability. Ninety-four subjects completed a diary every 15 min for 1 day, and subjects' moods, activities, and locations were assessed. Diurnal cycles were found for several moods (e.g., happy, tired), activities (e.g., discourse, thinking), and locations (e.g., home, work). Diurnal cycles in most moods were strongly associated with activities and location, yet diurnal cycles of some moods (rushed, sad, and tired) were not dependent on these factors. These findings have implications for mood assessment: Mood assessment performed only at particular times of day, or those relying on point assessment, may be influenced by time of day and by the activities and location of the subject.},

Managers (N = 120) were sampled. The main results were: First, no significant interaction effect of action orientation and life stress on well-being or motive-incongruent goal orientations was found. This was due to a strong action orientation and a low level of stress in the sample used (p {\textless} .001 when compared with norm). Because of restricted variance, the moderator hypotheses could not be supported or refuted. Second, motive-incongruent goal orientations correlated with well-being only when action orientation was checked. Thus, action orientation was found to be beneficial for well-being because it suppressed the negative effect of motive-incongruent goal orientations.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Routine infant immunisation with seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) began in the USA in 2000. Although invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially, the programme's effect on hospital admissions for pneumonia is unknown. We therefore assessed the effect of the programme on rates of all-cause and pneumococcal pneumonia admissions.
Methods
Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest inpatient database available in the USA, were analysed with an interrupted time-series analysis that used pneumonia (all-cause and pneumococcal) admission rates as the main outcomes. Monthly admission rates estimated for years after the introduction of PCV7 vaccination (2001{\textendash}2004) were compared with expected rates calculated from pre-PCV7 years (1997{\textendash}1999). The year of vaccine introduction (2000) was excluded, and rates of admission for dehydration were assessed for comparison.
Findings
At the end of 2004, all-cause pneumonia admission rates had declined by 39\% (95\% CI 22{\textendash}52) for children younger than 2 years, who were the target population of the vaccination programme. This annual decline in all-cause pneumonia admissions of 506 (291{\textendash}675) per 100 000 children younger than 2 years represented about 41 000 pneumonia admissions prevented in 2004. During the 8 study years, 10 659 (2\%) children younger than 2 years admitted with pneumonia were coded as having pneumococcal disease; these rates declined by 65\% (47{\textendash}77). This decline represented about 17 fewer admissions per 100 000 children in 2004. Admission rates for dehydration for children younger than 2 years remained stable over the study period.
Interpretation
The reduction in all-cause pneumonia admissions in children younger than 2 years provides an estimate of the proportion of childhood pneumonias attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae in the USA that are vaccine preventable. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children.},

The review of attitudes toward parenthood and childlessness reveals that people tend to believe that parenthood is central to a meaningful and fulfilling life, and that the lives of childless people are emptier, less rewarding, and lonelier, than the lives of parents. Most cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence suggest, however, that people are better off without having children. It is mainly children living at home that interfere with well-being, particularly among women, singles, lower socioeconomic strata, and people residing in less pronatalist societies-especially when these characteristics are combined. The discrepancy between beliefs and findings is discussed in relation to the various costs of parenting; the advantages of childlessness; adaptation and compensation among involuntarily childless persons; cognitive biases; and the possibility that parenthood confers rewards in terms of meaning rather than happiness.},

While most agree that there is no one preferred approach, it has also been argued that cluster mean centering is desirable when the within-cluster slope and the between-cluster slope are expected to deviate, and the main interest is in the within-cluster slope. However, we show in a series of simulations that if one has a multilevel autoregressive model in which the level 1 predictor is the lagged outcome variable (i.e., the outcome variable at the previous occasion), cluster mean centering will in general lead to a downward bias in the parameter estimate of the within-cluster slope (i.e., the autoregressive relationship). This is particularly relevant if the main question is whether there is on average an autoregressive effect. Nonetheless, we show that if the main interest is in estimating the effect of a level 2 predictor on the autoregressive parameter (i.e., a cross-level interaction), cluster mean centering should be preferred over other forms of centering. Hence, researchers should be clear on what is considered the main goal of their study, and base their choice of centering method on this when using a multilevel autoregressive model.},

	abstract = {In the United States happiness rises slightly, on average, from ages 18 to midlife, and declines slowly thereafter. This pattern for the total population is the net result of disparate trends in the satisfaction people get from various life domains: their financial situation, family life, health, and work. The slight rise in happiness through midlife is due chiefly to growing satisfaction with one's family life and work, which together more than offset decreasing satisfaction with health. Beyond midlife, happiness edges downward as a continuing decline in satisfaction with health is joined by diminishing satisfaction with one's family situation and work; these negative trends are offset considerably, however, by a sizeable upturn, in later life in people's satisfaction with their financial situation. These findings come from an analysis of the United States General Social Surveys, using the demographer's synthetic panel technique. They support neither the mainstream economics view that well-being depends only on one's objective conditions nor the psychologists' strong setpoint model in which adaptation to such conditions is rapid and complete. They are consistent with a "bottom up" model in which happiness is the net outcome of both objective and subjective factors in various life domains. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Even workers who are generally happy at work can suffer short-term losses of enthusiasm and fulfilment. Short-term fluctuations matter because they can better explain work-related well-being (e.g. work engagement, flow, positive affect or passion), employees' relations with other people at work (e.g. co-workers, clients), life outside work, and ultimately productivity. This article reviews what we know about short-term variations in employee well-being and highlights new theoretical assumptions and results from the seven articles in this special issue. The articles identify key psychological mechanisms involved in explaining within-person changes in well-being, including the ways in which people appraise events at work, the importance of humour, the sense of hope, and the balance between skills and challenges. Interventions that offer leadership training and cultivate signature strengths at work can also be effective in enhancing employee well-being. Boosting short-term well-being can make a big difference to employees and organizations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright The Tavistock Institute.]},

	abstract = {Unmeasured confounding is the principal threat to unbiased estimation of treatment {\textquotedblleft}effects{\textquotedblright} (i.e., regression parameters for binary regressors) in nonexperimental research. It refers to unmeasured characteristics of individuals that lead them both to be in a particular {\textquotedblleft}treatment{\textquotedblright} category and to register higher or lower values than others on a response variable. In this article, I introduce readers to 2 econometric techniques designed to control the problem, with a particular emphasis on the Heckman selection model (HSM). Both techniques can be used with only cross-sectional data. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I compare the performance of instrumental-variable regression (IVR) and HSM to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) under conditions with treatment and unmeasured confounding both present and absent. I find HSM generally to outperform IVR with respect to mean-square-error of treatment estimates, as well as power for detecting either a treatment effect or unobserved confounding. However, both HSM and IVR require a large sample to be fully effective. The use of HSM and IVR in tandem with OLS to untangle unobserved confounding bias in cross-sectional data is further demonstrated with an empirical application. Using data from the 2006{\textendash}2010 General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center, 2014), I examine the association between being married and subjective well-being.},

	abstract = {To explain country differences in an analytical or structural dependent variable, the application of a macro-micro-model containing contextual hypotheses is necessary. Our methodological study examines whether empirical studies apply such a model. We propose that a theoretical base for country differences is well described in multilevel studies, but aggregate and individual data analyses fail to specify contextual hypotheses ex ante (in the theory section of an article) and instead elaborate on macro-micro explanations ex post (in the discussion section). To test our assumptions, we analyzed 22 studies published in journals cited in the Social Science Citation Index between 2007 and 2010, which compare countries with respect to life satisfaction. Results are in accordance with our expectations. We conclude that cross-country comparisons should apply a macro-micro-model theoretically and empirically, if possible, and include the meso level, if appropriate. In case of insufficient data (i.e. only individual level or aggregate level data), applying a macro-micro-model theoretically may prevent premature conclusions.},
